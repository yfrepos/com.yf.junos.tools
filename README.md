# JuniperOS Tools Collection

This repository contains a collection of small tools built to work with Junos devices. Each tool lives in its own folder and includes its own README so it can be used independently from the rest of the project.

The structure is kept simple to allow adding more tools over time.

Current directory layout:

```
com.yf.junos.tools
└── convert.xml.to.excel
       main.py
```

Tools in this repository:

1. convert.xml.to.excel  
   A Python-based converter that reads Junos configuration exported in XML format and creates an Excel file to help with analysis and documentation.

This repository will expand with additional Junos-related utilities, each placed in its own directory.
